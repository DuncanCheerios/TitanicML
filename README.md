# TitanicML
My take on Kaggle Titanic Machine learning competition.  Explores different classifier techniques for approaching the problem!  For education and demonstration purposes only!

The Jupyter Notebook contains the walkthrough

Explores the following techniques for classifying the Titanic Dataset:
 * Decision Tree
 * Random Forest
 * Nearest Neighbors
 * Simple Sequential Neural Network
